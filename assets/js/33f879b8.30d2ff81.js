Each house has some money. You can rob houses from both streets, but you **cannot rob two adjacent houses from the same street** (alarms will trigger). What\'s the maximum money you can steal?\\r\\n```\\r\\nStreet A: [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]\\r\\nStreet B: [3, 2, 6, 8, 2]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Greedy Robber:** \\"I\'ll always rob the house with most money available!\\"\\r\\n- Rob B[0] = 3 (greedy)\\r\\n- Rob A[1] = 7 \\r\\n- Rob B[2] = 6\\r\\n- Rob A[3] = 3\\r\\n- Rob B[4] = 2 \\r\\n- **Total: 21**\\r\\n\\r\\n**DP Robber:** \\"Let me consider all valid combinations!\\"\\r\\n- Option 1: A[0]=2, B[1]=2, A[2]=9, B[3]=8, A[4]=1 \u2192 Total = 22\\r\\n- Option 2: B[0]=3, A[1]=7, B[2]=6, A[3]=3, B[4]=2 \u2192 Total = 21\\r\\n- **Best: 22** \\r\\n\\r\\n**Why Greedy Failed:** By greedily picking B[0] first, it blocked access to the optimal combination that includes both 9 and 8 from different streets!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n**When Greedy Works:** Problems with the \\"greedy choice property\\" where local optimal leads to global optimal (e.g., Activity Selection, Huffman Coding)\\r\\n**When DP is Needed:** Problems requiring exploring multiple choices where greedy fails (e.g., most optimization problems, counting problems)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n##  Pattern 1: Linear DP (1D)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\\r\\nThis is the foundation of DP.
