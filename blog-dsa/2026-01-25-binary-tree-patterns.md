Trees show up in almost every technical interview. Not because interviewers are obsessed with them, but because tree problems reveal how you think recursively, manage state, and break down complex problems into simpler ones.

2. [Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)
3. [Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)
4. [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)
