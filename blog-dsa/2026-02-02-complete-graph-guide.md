# **Complete Graph Problems & Resources Guide**

Hey everyone! I've been working on graph problems for both tech interviews and competitive programming, and I wanted to share a comprehensive guide that covers both aspects. Many resources focus on just one side, but mastering graphs requires understanding both the interview patterns and the deeper algorithmic concepts used in CP.

This guide includes curated problem lists, the best learning resources I've found, and a clear roadmap for both paths.

## **Understanding the Two Approaches**

**For Tech Interviews:** You need pattern recognition across 10-12 core patterns, clean code, and the ability to explain your approach clearly. About 80-100 well-understood problems is enough to crack most interviews. Focus on BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Dijkstra, and Union-Find.

**For Competitive Programming:** You need algorithmic depth, fast implementation with templates, and mastery of advanced algorithms. This requires 300+ problems and participation in contests. Everything from interviews plus advanced topics like SCC, HLD, Max Flow, and more.

## **Best Learning Resources**

### **Video Resources for Interview Prep**

**NeetCode - Graph Playlist** The best resource for learning interview patterns. Clear explanations with Python code covering 15 essential problems. It takes about 4-5 hours total.

**take U forward (Striver) - Graph Series** Comprehensive coverage with 50+ problems and all important algorithms. His explanations are detailed with C++/Java code. This is gold for interview prep, around 25-30 hours of content.

**Abdul Bari - Graph Algorithms** Perfect for understanding concepts deeply. His whiteboard teaching style makes complex algorithms crystal clear. About 15-20 hours of theory.

### **Video Resources for Competitive Programming**

**William Fiset - Graph Theory** Must-watch for CP. Complete graph theory course covering everything from basics to advanced algorithms like Tarjan's, Network Flow, and Bridges. About 10 hours total.

**Errichto - Contest Streams** Watch his live problem solving for advanced CP techniques. Great for seeing how top coders approach graph problems in real contests.

**Colin Galen** Excellent educational content on specific graph topics and optimizations for competitive programming.

### **Written Resources**

**For Interviews:**

* LeetCode Discuss section for graph problems

## **Learning Timeline**

### **For Interview Preparation (8 weeks)**

**Week 1: Graph Traversal** Solve Phase 1 problems (20 problems). Master BFS and DFS implementations. Understand when to use each. By the end, you should be able to code both from memory.

**Week 2: Cycle Detection & Topological Sort** Solve Phase 2 problems (15 problems). Learn cycle detection for both directed and undirected graphs. Master Kahn's algorithm for topological sort. Understand the applications of topological sort.

**Week 3: Shortest Path** Solve Phase 3 problems (15 problems). Master BFS for unweighted graphs. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm from scratch. Understand priority queue operations clearly.

**Week 4: Union-Find** Solve Phase 4 problems (15 problems). Implement DSU with path compression and union by rank. This data structure is elegant and appears frequently in interviews.

**Week 5: Advanced Topics** Solve Phase 5 problems (15 problems). Learn MST using Kruskal's algorithm. Understand bridges and articulation points. Study bipartite graph problems.

**Weeks 6-8: Practice & Review** Solve 20-30 mixed problems. Do mock interviews. Time yourself on medium problems (target 25-30 minutes). Review problems you struggled with.

### **For Competitive Programming (6 months)**

**Month 1: Foundations** Complete all basic CSES problems (1-10). Solve Codeforces problems rated 1200-1400. Focus on clean DFS and BFS implementations. Target 50-60 problems this month.

**Month 2: Shortest Paths** Complete CSES shortest path section. Learn Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall. Solve Codeforces 1400-1600 rated problems. Target 40-50 problems.

**Month 3: Core Algorithms** Study topological sort, cycle detection, DSU, and bipartite checking. Complete CSES problems 11-20. Solve Codeforces 1400-1600 problems. Target 50-60 problems.

**Month 4: Trees & SCC** Master tree DP and basic LCA. Learn Kosaraju's and Tarjan's algorithms for SCC. Complete CSES tree section. Solve Codeforces 1600-1800 problems. Target 40-50 problems.

**Month 5: Advanced Trees** Study Heavy-Light Decomposition and Centroid Decomposition. Learn advanced LCA techniques. Complete remaining CSES problems. Target 30-40 problems.

**Month 6: Advanced Topics** Learn Dinic's algorithm for max flow, 2-SAT, and advanced applications. Solve Codeforces 1800+ problems. Participate in virtual contests regularly. Target 30-40 problems.

---

## **Study Approach**

### **For Interviews**

Start with one pattern and solve 8-10 problems before moving to the next. When you encounter a problem, spend 20-30 minutes trying to solve it yourself. If stuck, look at hints or the approach (not the full solution), then implement yourself. After solving, review your code and optimize if possible.

Use spaced repetition: solve a problem today, revisit it after 3 days, then after a week, then after a month. This helps with long-term retention.

Focus on explaining your thought process clearly. Practice talking through your approach out loud.

### **For Competitive Programming**

Solve problems rated 200 points above your current rating. When you achieve 80% success rate, move up. Participate in 2-3 virtual contests per week. Always upsolve problems you couldn't solve during contests.

Read editorials even for problems you solved - you'll often learn better approaches. Build a template library as you learn algorithms. Practice implementing algorithms from scratch without looking at references.

Join contest discussions on Codeforces to learn from others. Don't spend more than 2 hours stuck on a single problem - read the editorial and implement it yourself.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

For interviews, quality matters more than quantity. Deeply understanding 80-100 problems across all patterns is better than superficially solving 500 problems. Focus on pattern recognition and clean implementation.

For competitive programming, consistency is key. Solve problems daily, participate in contests regularly, and gradually increase difficulty. Your rating will improve steadily with consistent practice.

Both paths are rewarding. Interview preparation helps you crack top tech companies. Competitive programming makes you a better programmer overall and opens doors to international competitions.

Choose your path based on your goals, but remember that the skills are complementary. Good luck with your graph journey!
