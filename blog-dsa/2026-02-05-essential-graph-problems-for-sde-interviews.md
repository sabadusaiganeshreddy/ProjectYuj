title: Essential Graph Problems for SDE Interviews

If you're having your placement season in a few months or want to revise graph concepts, I've made a list of hand-picked problems to cover the depth and breadth of graphs.

This isn't a magic list that guarantees you'll crack every interview or assessment. But these are standard problems and patterns I've consistently seen across interview experiences, company blogs, and my own preparation journey.

I've organized these by pattern because that's how interviews work, they don't ask "solve graph problem #47." They ask problems that test whether you understand BFS, topological sort, or Union Find. Once you recognize the pattern, the solution follows.

Think of this as your focused revision toolkit. Not too overwhelming, not too sparse. just the right problems to build strong pattern recognition.

Let's gooo!
