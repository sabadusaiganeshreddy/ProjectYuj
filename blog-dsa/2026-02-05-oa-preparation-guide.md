## Why These Problems Matter

These Q3 and Q4 problems are particularly valuable for OA preparation because they:

- **Match OA Difficulty**: Most online assessments feature problems at this exact difficulty level
- **Test Multiple Concepts**: They often combine multiple data structures and algorithms
- **Require Optimization**: You need to think beyond brute force solutions
- **Build Problem-Solving Speed**: Regular practice helps you recognize patterns faster
- **Simulate Real Conditions**: Contest timing mirrors actual OA time constraints

## Final Thoughts

Consistent practice with these contest problems will significantly improve your performance in online assessments. Remember that the goal isn't just to solve problems, but to develop pattern recognition and problem-solving intuition.
