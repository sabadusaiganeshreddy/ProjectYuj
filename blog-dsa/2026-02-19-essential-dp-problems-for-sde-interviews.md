If you're gearing up for placement season or trying to finally conquer DP (we've all been there!), I've compiled a list of hand-picked problems that cover the depth and breadth of dynamic programming.

**Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saiganeshreddysabadu/)** to stay updated with more coding resources, interview tips, and problem-solving strategies!

This isn't a guaranteed ticket to ace every DP question. DP is hard, arguably the hardest topic in DSA interviews. But these are the standard problems and patterns that keep showing up in actual interviews, coding assessments, and company hiring tests.

I've organized these by pattern types because that's how your brain will work during interviews. You won't think "ah, this is LeetCode #123." You'll think "this looks like a path-counting problem" or "this feels like interval DP."

Not too many problems to overwhelm you. Not too few to leave gaps. Just the focused set you need to build that DP intuition.

Let's crack DP together!

## Why This List Works

**Pattern-Based Organization**: Each section focuses on a specific DP pattern, making it easier to build mental models and recognize similar problems during interviews.

**Progressive Difficulty**: Within each pattern, problems range from fundamental to advanced, allowing you to build confidence gradually.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: From 1D DP fundamentals to advanced bitmask DP and game theory, this list covers all major DP patterns you'll encounter in interviews.

**Competitive Programming**: The CSES, AtCoder, and Codeforces problems provide additional challenge and help you develop speed and accuracy under time constraints.

## Final Thoughts

Don't just memorize solutions. **Understand the transitions.** That's what separates those who "get" DP from those who struggle with it.

This list represents the most important DP problems you should solve before interviews. It's not about quantity, it's about building strong pattern recognition and problem-solving intuition.

 DP is hard, but with focused practice on these patterns, you'll develop the intuition needed to tackle any DP problem in interviews.
